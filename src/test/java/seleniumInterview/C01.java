////What is Selenium?
//    //Selenium is a free (open source) tool for testing
//    //web applications across different web browsers and platforms.
//    //We also called it as an umbrella project.
//    //Why do you prefer Selenium Automation Tool? / What are the advantages of Selenium?
//    //I can say that when it comes to web automation testing tools, Selenium ranks is number one
//    //compare to the others. The reason behind that is outstanding open-source automation testing tool
//    //that can be executed in multiple browsers and operating systems,
//    //supporting a considerable amount of programming languages.
//    //The advantages of selenium are free to everyone.
//    //Supports many programming languages(Java,Python,C#)
//    //Works with multiple operating systems(Windows,Mac,Linux)
//    //It works with multiple browsers(Chrome,Safari,Mozilla,MicrosoftEdge)
//    //What are the disadvantages of Selenium? /What are the limitations of Selenium?
//    //You need to know programming language.
//    //Tests web-based applications only
//    //Selenium doesn't have professional support which means no technical support
//    //Limited support for Image Testing

    //What is Selenium?
    //• Selenium is a suite of software tools used to automate web-based applications
    //• It is an open-source suite of tools which means it does not require any licensing cost
    //Why do you prefer Selenium Automation Tool? / What are the advantages of Selenium?
    //• It is an open-source suite of tools that is why It is free to use without any licensing cost
    //• It supports various Operating environments like Windows, Linux, Macintosh, etc.
    //• It supports multiple languages like Java, Ruby, Python, C#, Perl, etc.
    //• It supports various browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Edge, IE, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.
    //• It is easy to learn and use in testing frameworks
    //What are the disadvantages of Selenium? /What are the limitations of Selenium?
    //• Selenium supports only web-based applications and, does not support desktop and mobile applications
    //• It cannot be used to automate graphics, captchas, barcodes, shapes, images, PDFs
    //• Reports cannot be generated directly through Selenium and it needs third party tools for report
    //generation activity like TestNG or JUnit
    //• Selenium is hard to synchronize with source code and automation testers need to use wait methods like
    //sleep(), implicit wait, explicit wait, etc.
    //• No built-in reporting tool, it needs third party tools for report generation activity
    //• It does not support file upload (can be done if we define the path

//2---Which testing types are supported by Selenium?
//• Smoke
//• Regression
//• Sanity
//• Functional tests (positive/negative UI tests)
//• Integration
//• End to end
//• Cross browser
//What are some open-source frameworks supported by Selenium?
//• Java based JUnit and TestNG unit testing frameworks
//o Java based Selenium frameworks can be integrated with Cucumber to provide BDD experience
//• C# based NUnit unit testing framework
//o C# based Selenium frameworks can be integrated with SpecFlow to provide BDD experience
//NOTE: These are not the only ones, Selenium is supporting so many other languages and frameworks created
